# Electric Board

Aim: Build an Electric Penny board. Why? :cool: :dash:

-> Penny boards are small, so can't hold a huge battery, but are easy to carry around - ideal for short commutes to lectures...

## Parts List

- :white_check_mark: Penny Board 
  - Currently we have two - a cheap one to test the build on, and mid-range one for the final version
- :white_check_mark: Electic Hub Motor - £70
  - Bought from [ebay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/353179721593)

  - Bought on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Focket-Electric-Skateboard-Longboard-Controller/dp/B07WHWV7HJ)
    - 36 V (doens't list cell count, but presumably 8 - 10S?)
  - This is likely not the best pace to source the part, considering it doesn't list any specs, nor is it well renowned for electronics. We shd aim to source another one
- :white_square_button: Batteries
  - :heavy_exclamation_mark: 18650 Li Ion batteries! We can use LiPo in testing, but Li ion are mandatory for final product!
  - Are we going to make the pack ourselves - we'll need a spot welder(?) (forgot actual term). [Great Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwhqn4BmC2I) did a good video comparing building this urself
  - Common configurations are: 6S2P or [10S2P > £100](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=10s2p+Battery)
  - Charger
  - BMS

## Research

- There are "Electric Wheel Combos" which specifiy how many of the wheels are electrified. This will affect factors such as cost, speed, space, batteries (more in parallel)
  - 1 Electric Wheel Combo
